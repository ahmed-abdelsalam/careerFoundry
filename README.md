# CareerFoundry Mentors
This is the tech challenge for careerFoundy back-end position.
- It's developed using ruby on rails in the back-end and a react in the front-end
- Please note that I had no prior experience in rails but I thought it will be fun to do the task in ruby on rails and I'll learn new things, and it was really great because I didn't know how much easy it's compared to other frameworks but it took me a while to wrap my head around the short-hand abstractions ðŸ˜ƒ

# Project Structure
## Models
- created 3 models
  - Student model which serves as a devise model that need an authentication system
  - Mentor model for storing mentors details
  - Call model which contains the meeting schedule details and it has a `blenogs_to` relationship with the Mentor & the Student
## Server Side Rendering
- Copied HTML structure from the careerFoundry website
  - added partial templates for header and footer
  - updated devise views for sign_in, sign_up, etc ...
## Client Side Rendering
- Used React for the main pages which only render after authentication
  - react pages all under the parent link /app served by `react-router`
  - create three main pages 
    - `/app/mentors` for selecting a mentor and schedule a meeting with him
    - `/app/agenda` for indexing all the scheduled meetings for my cuurent account
    - `/app/calendar` the main page for creating new meeting and show reserved meetings 

## Endpoints
- created namespace /api/v1 to serve JSON content for the react app
- merged data coming from the external API with the meetings saved locally to show all reserved time slots for each mentor
- CRUD operations for the meetings with taking consideration of deleting only future meeting
- When a meeting created it can't be created again

# TODO
- refine the testing suite
- enhance front end and styling
- use RVM
